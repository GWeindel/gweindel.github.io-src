Summary: My name is Gabriel Weindel and I am a cognitive scientist currently working at Aix-Marseille Université in the Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive and Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives. 

My name is Gabriel Weindel and I am a cognitive scientist currently working at Aix-Marseille Université (France) in the Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive and Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives. 

I am specialized in, and fond of, mental chronometry. This field of cognitive sciences, as I define it, addresses the question of the timing of information processing operated by the cognitive system implemented by our brains.
As a researcher my interest 
goes to the test and application of mathematical cognitive models to the general population or to populations with cognitive deficits.
