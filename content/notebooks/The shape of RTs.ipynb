And while for the researcher not specialized in mental chronometry that question might seem trivial, it actually sends you right to a really long, complexe and unfinished journey far from the shire (last film reference I promise). The main reason being that you cannot ask what distribution RTs have without also asking yourself what you are trying to measure and what your research question actually is about.\n",

    "This post is intended to be a speeded walkthrough for the modeling of reaction times.

    "For example we want to know how much digits a participant can remember (_i.e._ working memory). Imagine that this individual has a true working memory score but attentional fluctuations yields noise in the measurement. If we were to assume that this attentional fluctuation is distributed normally (participant is equally likely to deploy a low or high attention and most likely to deploy a mid-level attention) we could describe the $j$th sample of working memory score as drawn from a normal distribution with an estimated mean ($\\mu$) and a given standard deviation ($\\sigma$) which I write as follows :\n",

For example if you're a working on a plane cockpit and want to be sure that, _on average_ users will be faster to react given a certain design, then you will be interested in the mean RT _per se_. But often in cognitive science we use the measure of RTs as a proxy of some cognitive process. For example we could be interested in whether older people are slower to recognize a stimulus than younger participants. In this case, then mean RT might not be what we would like to infer on.\n",

    "The litterature on fitting different distribution to RTs is surprisingly large. The [post](https://lindeloev.github.io/shiny-rt/) by Jonas Kristoffer Lindel√∏v gives a nice (interactive) overview of different distributions applied to real observed $RT$s.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Ex-Gaussian\n",
    "Back in the mid-20th century, Christie and Luce, assumed that the distribution of $RT$s could be accounted by the convolution of an exponential and a normal distribution (but ex-Gaussian sounds better than ex-normal I guess). Their intuition was that two separated processes were contributing to RTs, one which distribution is normal and one which distribution is exponential. This gives the following likelihood function : \n",

    " \\end{equation}\n",

    "<img src=\"../resources/img/exgauss.png\" scale=\"20%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing $\\mu$, the mean of the gaussian process, shifts the distribution, while increasing $\\sigma$ increases the spread of RTs around $\\mu$ and increasing $\\tau$ increases the skew in the data. We therefore have a distribution geared to account for RTs and that is, in most cases, able to fit the data pretty well.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now this example illustrates the problem, while in the working memory example of the introduction the modeling of the effect on the mean was straigthforward it is no longer true for RTs. We could attribute explicitely a stage of RT to one parameter as Christie and Luce suggested initially. The authors thought that the exponential part of the distribution is linked to the decision time but other have quickly suggested that this part is linked to movement times (McGill, 1963). Since then no evidence has been found towards the correct interpretation of the parameters (see the paper by Matzke and Wagenmakers, 2008).\n",
